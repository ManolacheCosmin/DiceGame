# DiceGame

This project is a fun multiplayer game.  
The goal of the game is to reach 100 points.
The ''roll dice'' button generates a number between 1 and 6.
The ''hold'' button adds the sum of the generated random numbers to the current score.
The player can generate unlimited random numbers on his/her turn to win the game as long as the number it is not 1, in this case the sum is lost and the turn is passed to the next player.
